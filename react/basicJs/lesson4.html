        In last webpage we understood that if you return a reference of object
        method to a variable and call it, it returns window object. What if I
        say that we can fix this issue and make it look like a calling a method.

        We all knew that function is an object made by in-built object called
        Function(). There is an method for this Function() object called bind
        which can bind this method to an object.

<!--
    If you set border radius property half the value of width property in css, 
    then you will get a round image like profile pictures.

    Now our text lies after our image. To make them appear in same line and push image to left,
    set float to left

    To leave some space between text and image, margin-right 10px

    To make font of only username bold, give assign user name a class attribute called username
    and set font-weight to bold

    Now class is used to put different html tags in different categories. For example even though we have
    two <p> tag we differentiate them by giving username a class attribute which styles it in different way.

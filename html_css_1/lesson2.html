      If you set border radius property half the value of width property in css,
      then you will get a round image like profile pictures.
      <br />
      Now our text lies after our image.
      <br />
      To make them appear in same line and push image to left, set float to left
      To leave some space between text and image, margin-right 10px.
      <br />
      To make font of only username bold, give assign user name a class
      attribute called username and set font-weight to bold Now class is used to
      put different html tags in different categories.
      <br />
      For example even though we have two tag we differentiate them by giving
      username a class attribute which styles it in different way.

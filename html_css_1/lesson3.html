      I am designing my webpage using
      <em>emphasis tag</em>
      . By default em tag uses italic as styling Note emphais tag is not italic
      always and it is not used for styling. Look the following
      <em class="des">emphasis tag</em>
      . This tag gives importance to that text Example of
      <i>italic tag</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      this tag uses
      <strong>strong tag</strong>
      . By default strong is styled with bold letters.
    </p>

    <!--strong and em are not used for styling. Using them makes seo search for content fast-->

    <p>Let us take a look about heading.</p>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>
      Acc to this h1 tag is bigger and h6 tag is smaller. Note heading tags are
      not about styling, they are about heirachial importance.
      <br />
      The document should contain only one h1, because if there are too many h1
      tags then your page will not appear first in search result as there are
      more than one h1 so seo optimazition will decrease.
      <br />
      Browser don't know about what this webpage is all about.
      <br />
      We can do anything with css, increase font size of h6 that looks like h1
      and decrease the font size of h1 to h6.
      <br />
      Note, always use h1 to tell what is this page all about. h1 tells the
      title of this webpage

    <p>
      In this webpage we are going take a look on entities.
      <br />
      When you want to write something in &lt;&gt; brackets html ignores it and
      considers it as a tag.
      <br />
      So to avoid this we use something known as entities.
      <br />
      use ampersandlt; for &lt;
      <br />
      use ampersandgt; for &gt;
      <br />
      for copyrights symbol use ampersandgt; &copy;
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      we can also use entities to do something called non-breaking space.

    <p>
      I am designing my webpage using
      <em>emphasis tag</em>
      . By default em tag uses italic as styling
    </p>
    <p>
      Note emphais tag is not italic always. Look the following
      <em class="des">emphasis tag</em>
      . This tag gives importance to that text
    </p>
    <p>
      Example of
      <i>italic tag</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      this tag uses
      <strong>strong tag</strong>
      . By default strong is styled with bold letters.
    </p>

    <!--strong and em are not used for styling. Using them makes seo search for content fast-->

    <p>Let us take a look about heading.</p>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <!--
      Acc to this h1 tag is bigger and h6 tag is smaller. Note heading tags are not about styling, they are about heirachial importance.
      But the document should contain only one h1, because if there are too many h1 then your page will not appear first in search result, because 
      there are more h1 so seo optimazition will decrease. Browser don't know about what this webpage is all about.
      We can do anything with css, increase font size of h6 that looks like h1 and decrease the font size of h1 to h6.
      Note, always use h1 to tell what is this page all about
     
    -->

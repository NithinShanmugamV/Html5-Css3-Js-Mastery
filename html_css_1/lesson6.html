      In this webpage we are going to see about hyperlinks. Always webpages have
      links that navigates to same page or different page. We use anchor element
      to create these links.
      <br />
      <br />

      <button onclick="alert('anchor element')">&lt;a href =''&gt;</button>
      <br />
      href is short for hyper text reference which means url.
    </p>

    <div>
      Lets make a image as link
      <br />
      <a href="../js1/index.html">
        <img class="img" src="pic/myimg.jpg" />
      </a>
      <p>
        when you hover over an image icon changes to hand indicating that image
        is clickable
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      relative url search for webpage with respect to folder where this document
      is.
      <br />
      For example let us assume root folder has two folders named html_css_1 and
      js1 where folder 1 has lesson1.html and lesson6.html whereas folder2 has
      index.html to goto lesson1 webpage which is present in same folder,
      <br />
      <a href="lesson1.html">&lt;a href ='lesson1.html'&gt;</a>
      <br />
      to goto index webpage which is present in different folder,
      <br />
      <a href="../js1/index.html">&lt;a href ='../js1/index.html'&gt;</a>
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are in deeply nested structure you want to go multiple levels up .
      For example consider you are present 4 folders inside from home directory
      and you want to go to index page which is in home directory. Then relative
      url looks like ../../../../js1/index1.html which goes 4 levels up.But this
      looks messy so instead we use absolute url &lt;a href ='/index.html'&gt;
      where / represents home directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can aslo link to non-html docs like images, pdfs etc.
      <a href="pic/myimg.jpg">&lt;a href ="pic/myimg.jpg"&gt;</a>
      <br />
      If you want to make user download the image then add download attribute
      <a href="pic/myimg.jpg" download>
        &lt;a href ="pic/myimg.jpg" download&gt;
      </a>
    </p>

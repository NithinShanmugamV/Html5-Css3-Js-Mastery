        Unsplash website has lot of free images. So you can search and use
        images those images.
        <br />
        While naming the image, you can name whatever you want but always give a
        descriptive name of what is in the image. This is a search Engine
        Optimization trick, by which search engines can understand webpages
        better and show your results at top.

      <img src="pic/water-droplet.jpg" alt="water droplet" class="before" />
      <img src="pic/water-droplet.jpg" alt="water droplet" class="after" />
      <br />
      Although alt is not a necessary attribute, it can be useful for following
      reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>
          When visually impaired people uses screen reader it reads the alt text
          for them when it encounters with image.
        </li>
        <li>It is also used in Search Engine Optimization.</li>
        <li>
          It is also used when image doesn't load. When image doesn't load it
          shows the alt text.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you use a rectangler image and make it look like a square image
        using css, it squashes the image. So to overcome this we use object-fit
        and set it to cover.

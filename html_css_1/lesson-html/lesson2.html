        If you set border radius property to half the value of width property in
        css, then you will get a round image like one shown above. Now our text
        lies after our image.
        <br />
        To make them appear in same line and push image to left, set float to
        left To leave some space between text and image, margin-right 10px.
        <br />
        To make font of only username bold, give assign user name a class
        attribute called username and set font-weight to bold Now class is used
        to put different html tags in different categories.
        <br />
        For example even though we have two tag we differentiate them by giving
        username a class attribute which styles it in different way.

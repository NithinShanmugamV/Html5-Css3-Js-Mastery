      Earlier we have seen about objects - (collection of key value pairs
      property and its value). So if you have properties that are highly related
      to each other, we can encapsulate them inside an object. For example, Let
      us take student's exam results of three subjects instead of declaring it
      in 3 different variables we can declare it inside an object. Obviously you
      can declare those keys(properties - physics, maths...) as varibles outside
      object. But it is better to follow this approach as these variables are
      related to each other. we call this object orinted programming.

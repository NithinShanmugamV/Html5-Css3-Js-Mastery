      Property constructor references the function that was used to construct or
      create that object. Inspect this webpage.

      When we look at constructor property of factory functions we get f which
      is function and Object(). What is that Object()? This is a built in
      constructor function in JavaScript.
      <br />
      <br />
      When we create an object using object literal syntax => {}(which we use
      for factory functions), internally the JavaScript engine uses this
      constructor function For example, when we create an object using object
      literal syntax
      <br />
      let x ={};
      <br />
      js will do something like this
      <br />
      let x = new Object();
      <br />
      where Object() is built-in fuction. So our object Student1 which was
      created by factory functions, is created using constructor function
      Object() internally.
      <br />
      <br />
      We also have few other built-in functions.
      <br />
      new String(); creates string but often we use string literal like '',"",``
      <br />
      new Boolean(); creates boolean but often we use boolean literal like true
      or false
      <br />
      new Number(); creates numbers but often we use number literal like
      1,2,3,...
